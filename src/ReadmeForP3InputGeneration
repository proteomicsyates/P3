To get input for P3:
This has to be run for each different specie that you have in the data

Write Bait.txt files
(contains the name of the baits in the dataset)


For the input data put all DB-Proteins.txt files in the same directory (inputs)


For the control data put all DB-Proteins.txt control files in the same directory (control)


Create an output directory


For the PeptideCutter file
Run src/GetUniprotAccessionNumberAndGeneNames.java over a fasta file downloaded from UniProt
to get UniProt_Mouse_Accession_And_GeneName_SALVA.txt

## This isn't seem to be applicable now, but just in case...who knows... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
## Change the loop limit of line 127 of PeptideCutterParser.java so that you process all proteins in UniProt_Mouse_accession_And_GeneName.txt (7762) in the case of rat.
#######

Run src/PeptideCutterParser.java with input UniProt_Mouse_Accession_And_GeneName_SALVA.txt. It generates the file peptide_cutter.txt

and then

Run src/PeptideCutterNameNormalization.java giving the file peptide_cutter.txt generated before as input.
It generates PepCutterNameFixed.txt
That is the input file for P3 when it asks for the peptide cutter file.


For the orthogonal data requested by P3:

BioGRID
In src/bioparser, there is BioParser:
Run Bioparser.java with as input the BioGrid file of the organism of interest (tab2 format, i.e. BIOGRID-ORGANISM-Mus_musculus-3.4.139.tab2.txt) and select the output folder.
This outputs two files which serve as input for P3:
XX_genetic.txt
XX_physical.txt
XX being the input file.

STRING
Use this command to get the second column of the file created before (ACC-Genes), so containing the Gene names only: 
cut -f2 UniProt_Mouse_Accession_And_GeneName_SALVA.txt > AllGeneNames_Mouse_SALVA.txt

Run StringOntoGetter.java (which is on /src/parser) with two input files in this order:
(this program will go to String RESTfull webservice to get a table per protein and parse the data)
1. All gene names of the organism (). (The file created before)
2. An empty file (EmptyPreyFile.txt) 

String_10090.txt (all of string)
and
String_exp_10090.txt (Using only experimental data from String)
One of these files can be used to run with P3 (the user choose)
